# CPU baseline

The first ADI baseline was measured on 2026-08-05 with a Release build on one
8-core AMD EPYC 9645 virtual machine (one thread per core). The model was the
7.07 GiB ADI GGUF produced from Mach-1-Additive-35B.

| Operation | Shape or scope | Time |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Expert projection | 512 x 2048 | 8.56 ms |
| Non-expert projection | 512 x 2048 | 2.35 ms |
| Routed FFN | top-8 plus shared expert | 36.96 ms |
| Full attention | one cached token, one layer | 52.18 ms |
| Gated DeltaNet | one recurrent token, one layer | 65.84 ms |
| Output head | 31,040 x 2048 chunk | 18.76 ms |
| Complete decoder | 40 layers plus full head | 4.13 s/token |

The complete decoder reached 0.242 tokens/s, up from the initial scalar
0.0322 tokens/s baseline. These numbers are correctness-oriented starting
points, not tuned ceilings. The implementation uses simple row/tile
parallelism across eight cores; it does not yet use architecture-specific SIMD,
persistent worker threads, batched prompt evaluation, or NUMA tuning.

Reproduce the component suite:

```bash
tools/benchmark_cpu.sh models/Mach-1-Additive-35B.gguf
```

Add `--full` to include the slower full-token measurement.
